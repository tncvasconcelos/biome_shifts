Description of folders: 
 
- **1_occurrence_data/** 
  
Folder containing filtered occurrence points and list of biomes where species occur. 


- **2_trees/** 
 
Folder containing original taxized tree files used in all analyses. 

- **3_organized_datasets_muhisse/** 
  
Folder containing input files for muhisse analyses.


- **4_organized_trees_muhisse/**

Folder containing input trees for muhisse analyses.

- **5_results/**

Scripts:

> 00_utility_functions.R
  
Script containing custom functions necessary to run all following scripts. Often these functions are used repeatedly in different scripts.


> 01.1_retaxizing_trees.R



> 01_organizing_trees.R



> 02.1_visual_inspection_post_curation.R



> 02_sending_names_gbif.R



> 03_clean_gbif.R



> 04_get_habitat.R



> 05_run_muhisse.R
Loads processed data from previous scripts and formats the data to match muhisse model specificiations. Then creates a set of muhisse models which allow for character dependent and character independent rate hetoergeneity. Fits and saves the muhisse models for all data.


> 06_muhisse_recon.R
Preforms ancestral state reconstruction on previous muhisse results (see 05_run_muhisse.R).


> 07_muhisse_table.R
Summarizes the parameters of previous muhisse results (see 05_run_muhisse.R). This summarization includes model averaging based on AIC weight of each model applied to each dataset. This script produces the table 'all_par_table.csv' containing model averaged parameters. 


> 08_muhisse_plots.R
Generates plots based on the data from 'all_par_table.csv'. Additionally, runs significance tests via phylogenetic t-tests and phylogenetic generalized least squares regression.

Other files:

> WCVP_life_form_description.txt

> all_par_table.csv
Tabular data summarizing the muhisse results for each clade. Each row represents a different clade analyzed. Columns A through U contains model averaged parameter estimates. Columns V through Y contains the sum of the AIC weight supporting particular rate heterogeneity scenarios. Column Z contains the number of taxa for each clade used in the analysis. Generated by 07_muhisse_table.R
